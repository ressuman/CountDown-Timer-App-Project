# JavaScript in Web Browsers

## üéØ Objectives

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, and objects. I will also learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create interactive web pages.

## ‚úÖ Task: Countdown App

- Open the `task-2-countdown-app` folder in VS Code and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- I should see a countdown app with multiple countdown timers.
- My task is to make the countdown timers work.
- For this task, I will need to edit the just the `script.js` file.

- **_Hint:_** Look up the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) method in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) method in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) method in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) method in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) method in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) property in JavaScript.
- **_Hint:_** Look up the [classList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) property in JavaScript.
